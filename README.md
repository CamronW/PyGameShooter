# PyGame Snake

A basic shooter game using the PyGame library. This is a game purely created for me to practice Python and is not meant to be player as a real game.

### Prerequisites



```
- PyGame (https://www.pygame.org/)
```

### Installing

1. Ensure PyGame is Installed
2. Run game.py


### Features


```
- Player movement
- Player shooting
- Bullet tracking and collision 
- Constantly spawning enemies
- A variety of guns and bullet mechanics
- "Pickups" have a chance of dropping randomly on the map when an enemy is killed
- Pickups include more lives, as well as different guns
- Money system
- Lives System using collision between enemies and players
- Make the shop button use events rather than checking mouse pos and if it's clicked
```
### Work in Progress

```
- Shop system (Currently clicking shop pauses the game as intended, however nothing yet had been added to it)
```

### Todo

```
- Death at 0 lives
- Add items to shop
- More enemy types
```
